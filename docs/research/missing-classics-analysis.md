# Alexandria Missing Classics - Gap Analysis

**Generated:** 2026-01-21
**Census Base:** 9,383 books analyzed

Analysis of critical authors/books that are **missing** from Alexandria, grouped by domain.

---

## Database Theory & Relational Model ❌ CRITICAL

### Missing Authors:
1. **C.J. Date & Hugh Darwen** - "An Introduction to Database Systems" (industry must-have)
2. **E.F. Codd** - "The Relational Model for Database Management" (founder of relational theory)
3. **Fabian Pascal** - "Practical Issues in Database Management" (relational purist)
4. **Joe Celko** - "SQL for Smarties" (SQL anti-patterns, best practices)

**Impact:** Silverston covers data modeling patterns, but theoretical foundation of normalization and relational algebra is missing.

**Recommended Addition:**
- Date & Darwen: "Database in Depth" (2005) - most accessible intro to relational theory
- Celko: "Joe Celko's SQL for Smarties" (any version) - SQL idioms, temporal logic

---

## UX Design & Human-Computer Interaction ❌ CRITICAL

### Missing Authors:
1. **Don Norman** - "The Design of Everyday Things" (affordances, signifiers - key for WBF UI)
2. **Jakob Nielsen** - "Designing Web Usability" (heuristics, usability testing)
3. **Steve Krug** - "Don't Make Me Think" (intuitive UI design)
4. **Jared Spool** - UX research articles/books

**Current Status:** You have Kahneman (cognitive load), but **practical UX principles** are missing.

**Impact:** WBF Distribution module UI design would benefit from Norman's affordances and Krug's simplicity principles.

**Recommended Addition:**
- Norman: "The Design of Everyday Things" (Revised 2013)
- Krug: "Don't Make Me Think, Revisited" (3rd Edition)

---

## Philosophy - Political & Ethics ⚠️ PARTIAL

### Present:
- ✅ John Stuart Mill - "On Liberty" (utilitarianism)

### Missing:
1. **Immanuel Kant** - "Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals" (Categorical Imperative - crucial for AI ethics!)
2. **John Rawls** - "A Theory of Justice" (fairness, social contract)
3. **Robert Nozick** - "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" (libertarian counterpoint to Rawls)
4. **Michael Sandel** - "Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?" (applied ethics, accessible)

**Impact:** For questions like "Should WBF automate QC and replace inspectors?", Kant is **essential** reading.

**Recommended Addition:**
- Kant: "Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals" (Hackett edition, James W. Ellington translation)
- Sandel: "Justice" (accessible intro to ethical frameworks)

---

## Manufacturing & Operations Management ❌ CRITICAL FOR WBF!

### Missing (SHAME for WBF project!):
1. **Eliyahu M. Goldratt** - "The Goal" (Theory of Constraints - TOC)
2. **James P. Womack & Daniel T. Jones** - "Lean Thinking" (Lean principles, Toyota way)
3. **W. Edwards Deming** - "Out of the Crisis" (Total Quality Management, Plan-Do-Check-Act)
4. **Taiichi Ohno** - "Toyota Production System" (JIT, Kanban, Muda/Mura/Muri)
5. **Jeffrey Liker** - "The Toyota Way" (14 Toyota principles)

**Current Status:** **GAP!** You don't have a SINGLE manufacturing classics book.

**Impact:** WBF is an MES (Manufacturing Execution System) without theoretical foundation. Goldratt's TOC directly applicable to:
- Bottleneck analysis (Warping, Prepreg, Packing delays)
- Drum-Buffer-Rope scheduling
- Throughput accounting (vs cost accounting)

**Recommended Addition (PRIORITY #1):**
- Goldratt: "The Goal" (novel format, easy to read, game-changer)
- Womack & Jones: "Lean Thinking" (5 lean principles)
- Ohno: "Toyota Production System" (original Lean/JIT source)

## Action Plan: Filling the Gaps

### Priority #1: Manufacturing Classics (for WBF)
```
[ ] Goldratt - The Goal (Theory of Constraints)
[ ] Womack & Jones - Lean Thinking
[ ] Ohno - Toyota Production System
[ ] Deming - Out of the Crisis
[ ] Liker - The Toyota Way
```

**Rationale:** WBF is an MES for composite manufacturing. Without these books, we lack theoretical foundation for:
- Bottleneck optimization (Warping delays, Prepreg capacity)
- Waste elimination (Muda/Mura/Muri)
- Pull systems vs push systems (Kanban vs schedule-driven)

### Priority #2: UX Design Classics (for WBF UI)
```
[ ] Norman - The Design of Everyday Things
[ ] Krug - Don't Make Me Think
[ ] Nielsen - Designing Web Usability (optional)
```

**Rationale:** WBF Distribution module will have new UI/UX requirements. Nataša's workflow pain points (manual data entry, no real-time visibility) require UX expertise.

### Priority #3: Database Theory (for WBF data modeling)
```
[ ] Date & Darwen - Database in Depth
[ ] Celko - SQL for Smarties
[ ] Fabian Pascal - Practical Issues in Database Management (optional)
```

**Rationale:** Silverston covers data model patterns, but theoretical foundation of normalization/denormalization is missing.

### Priority #4: Philosophy/Ethics (for AI decision-making)
```
[ ] Kant - Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals
[ ] Rawls - A Theory of Justice
[ ] Sandel - Justice (accessible intro)
```

**Rationale:** WBF Rule Engine automates decisions. Ethical frameworks needed for evaluating:
- Automated quality inspection (replaces workers?)
- Resource allocation (which order has priority?)
- Exception handling (who bears cost of errors?)

- NOT A SINGLE organizational change author (Lewin, Kotter, Senge) - critical for rollout
- Sartre/Kierkegaard completely absent (but Nietzsche/Camus complete)
- Foucault/Derrida gap (but Barthes present)

### Interpretation: Alexandria Personality Profile

**Alexandria is:**
- **Multidisciplinary** (technical + psychology + philosophy + history + esoteric)
- **Practice-oriented** (software patterns over pure theory)
- **Depth-psychology heavy** (Jung/Campbell/Eliade definitely favorites!)

- **Manufacturing-blind** (MAJOR gap for production-focused project!)

**What's missing:**
1. **Operations excellence** (TOC, Lean, TQM)
2. **Formal UX theory** (has Kahneman for cognitive load, lacks Norman for affordances)
3. **Mainstream philosophy** (Mill present, Kant/Rawls missing)
4. **Change management** (organizational behavior gap)

### Next Steps

**For PoC (10 books), use WHAT YOU HAVE:**
