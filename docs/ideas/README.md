# docs/ideas/

Future visions, concepts, and briefs that **haven't entered TODO yet**.

## Contents

- **Librarians.md** - Specialized BMad agents for library operations
- **Makers.md** - Voting/consensus mechanism for critical decisions
- **Temporal Knowledge Layer.md** - Knowledge graph with Graphiti/Neo4j

## Rules

- No checkboxes here - these are visions, not task lists
- When ready to implement, extract tasks to `TODO.md` and delete the brief
- Keep briefs concise and focused on the "what" and "why"

## Lifecycle

1. Idea written as brief here
2. Decision to implement → extract tasks to `TODO.md`
3. Brief deleted (or moved to `docs/backlog/` if details needed during implementation)
