# User Documentation

End-user documentation organized following the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) framework.

## Structure

| Folder | Diataxis Quadrant | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| [tutorials/](./tutorials/) | Learning-oriented | Step-by-step lessons |
| [how-to/](./how-to/) | Task-oriented | Practical recipes |
| [explanation/](./explanation/) | Understanding-oriented | Conceptual discussions |

## Note on Reference

The Diataxis "Reference" quadrant is covered by [../architecture/](../architecture/) which contains:
- C4 diagrams (system structure)
- Technical specifications
- API documentation

Architecture documentation spans both Reference and Explanation, so it's kept as a separate top-level section.
