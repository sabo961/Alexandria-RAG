# docs/backlog/

Detailed documentation for **active TODO items**.

When a task in `TODO.md` needs more context, create a detailed doc here and link to it from the TODO item.

## Lifecycle

1. Task added to `TODO.md` with link: `[details](docs/backlog/feature-x.md)`
2. Work happens, doc gets updated
3. Task completed → remove from `TODO.md`, delete doc from here
