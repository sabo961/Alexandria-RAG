user_description: |-
  Alexandria je RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) sustav za semantičko pretraživanje
  9,000+ knjiga iz Temenos Academy knjižnice. MCP-first arhitektura - primarni interface
  je MCP Server za Claude Code integraciju. GUI (Streamlit) napušten u korist MCP pristupa.

  Ključne značajke:
  - Hijerarhijsko chunkanje (parent chapters + child semantic chunks)
  - Universal Semantic Chunking (ADR 0007) - topic boundary detection
  - Calibre integracija za metadata
  - Collection-specific manifesti za tracking

# SYNC NOTE: Projekt je evoluirao izvan BMAD workflowa s "godp. Primarius" (Opus).
# Dokumentacija u docs/ je authoritative source of truth.

        notes: |-
          Formal PRD not created. Project direction established through:
          - docs/project-overview.md (informal product vision)
          - TODO.md (prioritized backlog)
          - ADRs (architecture decisions capture requirements implicitly)
          Brownfield project with clear existing scope - PRD deemed unnecessary.

        notes: |-
          No formal epics/stories. Work tracked via:
          - TODO.md (prioritized backlog HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
          - CHANGELOG.md (completed work archive)
          Suitable for solo/small team brownfield maintenance.

        notes: "Not formally run, but system is in production with MCP server operational."

        notes: |-
          Continuous development model, not sprint-based.
          Work tracked in TODO.md with priorities.
