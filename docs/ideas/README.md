## Rules

- No checkboxes here - these are visions, not task lists
- When ready to implement, extract tasks to `TODO.md` and delete the brief
- Keep briefs concise and focused on the "what" and "why"

## Lifecycle

```
1. Idea written as brief here
2. Decision to implement → extract tasks to TODO.md
3. Brief deleted (or moved to docs/backlog/ if details needed)
```
